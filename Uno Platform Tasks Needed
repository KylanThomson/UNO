| Design Tokens |
- Creation of design tokens, whether itâ€™s in figma or AWS style dictionary we should find our color palette and our design standards and begin creation of a reference page.  It is too inefficient to continuously need to reference color hex codes for individual components within our figma design projects rather than knowing our color and standards for specific components and colors.
- Colorwise, a good start would be two standard blacks (lighter and darker), a standard white (preferably a bit off-white), a couple shades of a accent color (this can be any color), OR instead of one of the accent shades, a grey header color for use under title cards and as footers

| OS to release to: where to prioritize app release and platform release |
- What platforms are we releasing to first, and where do our priorities lie? Are we going to focus on maintaining equity within releases to keep each version for each OS even, or do we plan on advancing a specific OS (likely Windows)?

| Customization, and comparing ourselves to other multi-platform design systems |
- Customization of the platform will change EVERYTHING.  Before we begin design, we need to figure out what we want to be able to be customized, how much freedom of customization we want to give the user, etc.  This means deciding this for every piece of information and every individual menu within the software.
