MULTI-PLATFORM DESIGN SYSTEMS:
- Design systems, pros and cons
  - Salesforce Lightning Design System
    - Complex interface with heavily customizable, collaborative homepage
    - Modules work hand-in-hand and can be used in conjunction with one another
    - Transparent and user-oriented security features, allowing developers and other employees to have complete knowledge and control over who sees what in the collaborative interface
    - User created automation for specific tasks within the system
    - Creation of responsive business applications with little to no coding experience
    - Con: convoluted and challenging to learn, we want to set Uno apart from this, making the UI simplified while still offering some customization and automation within the system
    - TAKEAWAYS: Salesforce is definitely both the largest and most customizable design system. This is a design system we should compare with Uno, essentially building down from the top, taking a look at all the features, and finding the things we should remove/whittle down to successfully separate ourselves from the other design systems on the market.
